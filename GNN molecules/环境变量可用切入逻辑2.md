1.  核心嵌入点：变量嵌入层和标准化后的SMILE 链接

2.  具体方法：Below is a concise overview of how the authors **standardize** both the SMILES strings and the accompanying numeric variables (e.g., log Kow, charge product, etc.) in order to feed them into the multimodal transformer and thereby capture the effect of molecular structure.***## 1. Canonicalizing and Tokenizing SMILES

    1.  **Consistent SMILES**:

        *   Although the paper does not describe all details of canonicalization, a common practice is to convert each PFAS molecule to a *canonical* SMILES (e.g., via RDKit or a similar cheminformatics toolkit). This ensures that each molecule’s SMILES representation is unique and consistent.

    2.  **Tokenization**:

        *   Each SMILES string is then broken into “tokens”—for example, individual atoms (`C`, `F`, `O`) or symbols (`(`, `)`, `=`, etc.). Each token gets mapped to a numeric “token ID,” similar to how words are tokenized in NLP.

    3.  **Padding to Fixed Length**:

        *   Because different PFAS molecules can have SMILES strings of different lengths, the authors unify them to a *fixed maximum length* (determined by the longest SMILES in their dataset).
        *   If a SMILES has fewer tokens than that maximum length, the model pads it with zeros (or a special `[PAD]` token). This way, each sample has a consistent dimensional shape for the transformer.

    Thus, “standardizing SMILES” essentially means **canonicalizing** them so they’re all comparable, **tokenizing** them, and **padding** them to the same length for batch training.***## 2. Preparing Numeric Variables

    1.  **Typical Scaling**:

        *   For numeric descriptors (e.g., `charge product`, `MWCO`, `log Kow`, `pKa`, etc.), it is standard practice to scale or normalize them before training. (Though the paper does not specify exactly which scaler—like min–max or standard scaling—they used, it is typical to ensure all numeric features are on similar ranges.)

    2.  **Separate “Feature Columns”**:

        *   These scaled numeric variables form their own vector (e.g., `[charge_product, MWCO, logKow, ...]`).
        *   In a multimodal transformer, that vector can be fed either (a) into a small “embedding layer” so it matches the dimension of the SMILES embeddings, or (b) concatenated at a later layer—depending on the model design.

    ***## 3. How the Model Merges SMILES + Numeric Inputs

    1.  **Multimodal Inputs**:

        *   The tokenized SMILES are processed through the transformer’s “attention” mechanism (akin to NLP).
        *   The numeric features (membrane properties, PFAS properties, operational conditions) enter as an additional input channel. For instance, the authors may embed each numeric feature and then concatenate that embedding with the SMILES-embedding at some layer in the network.

    2.  **Attention Mechanism**:

        *   The transformer learns which tokens (i.e., which parts of the PFAS structure) are most relevant to predicting removal.
        *   Simultaneously, it also sees the numeric descriptors (like charge product, MWCO, etc.) so it can correlate them with the structural features in the SMILES.

    3.  **Post-hoc Interpretation**:

        *   By extracting *attention scores* for each SMILES token, the authors can see which functional groups (carboxyl vs. sulfonate, for instance) drive the rejection predictions the most.
        *   Meanwhile, numeric-feature importance can still be analyzed (though less directly) by looking at how overall predictions change as each numeric variable shifts—similar in spirit to SHAP, but now within the transformer framework.

    ***### Key Takeaways

    *   **SMILES standardization**: Canonicalizing + tokenizing + zero-padding ensures that all PFAS structures can be compared and batch-processed consistently.
    *   **Numeric-feature scaling**: Numeric variables are typically standardized (e.g., scaled to a similar range) so that each feature exerts a comparable effect in training.
    *   **Combined (multimodal) model**: The transformer sees *both* the tokenized SMILES and the numeric descriptors, enabling it to learn how structural differences (from SMILES) interact with membrane or PFAS properties (from numeric features).

    By following these steps, the authors can isolate how *both* the “bulk” features (e.g., log Kow, MWCO) **and** the fine-grained SMILES representation of each PFAS molecule influence the predicted removal efficiency.
